### Compile and Run
- Be in the first folder of the project, you should be able to see README.md
- In the commandline type **gradlew desktop:dist**, this creates the runnable jar file
- When that is done you then type **gradlew desktop:run** and the game should start

### How to Play
After you click play and select the map that you wish to play on you should be brought to the game.  At the bottom of the screen there is a bunch of images these represent the towers and traps that you can use.  The first four images are the towers that you can play.  The first tower is a single shot tower that will fire one shot at a time, the second tower is the DOT tower, this shoots a cloud of gas that does damage over time, the third tower is and AOE tower this will do damage in a radius, the final tower is a Laser this will shoot a beam forward only and wont turn at all.  You can rotate the towers 90 degrees by pressing **'r'**.  You click once to select the tower and then click where you wish to place, there is an X in the bottom right that is used to cancel.  Click on a placed tower to improve the tower to give it extra effects.
The last four are your traps.  The first is a barricade that will stop creeps for a few seconds, the second is a bomb and will do a lot of damage to creeps if they are in the AOE, the third is glue which will slow up to 5 creeps for a few seconds, the last trap is spikes that will do damage to up to 5 creeps.  To place the traps do the same as with the towers.

There are 10 rounds per map except for the Boss level.  In between every round there is a planning phase to prepare for the next round.  You can click the play button to skip this planning phase if you want, click the pause button to bring you to a menu where you can select a few options or resume from where you were.
